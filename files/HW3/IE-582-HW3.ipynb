    "Using different weights for the dimensions may make sense because these gestures are made by humans on a 3d Earth environment. In this environment, the effect of gravity should be considered while trying to recognize motions. Since there is a constant gravitational force, the vertical movements may be less discriminative than the movements on the other dimensions. Therefore, one alternative to improve the performance of such algorithm would be weighting the z-axis (vertical axis) acceleration less than the other two dimensional movements."
